What is libhades?
-----------------

libhades is a small wrapper around LAPACK and BLAS. While LAPACK and
BLAS are very fast and reliable, the API is from the 70ies. For example,
zgeev, the routine to compute eigenvalues and left and/or right eigenvectors
of a generic complex matrix, has 14 arguments!

libhades tries to make things easier for you. It defines a simple matrix type
for complex and real matrices and gives you simple functions to add or multiply
matrices, to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors, calculate the matrix exponential
for arbitrary matrices, to solve differential equations, to invert matrices or
to calculate a LU decomposition and much more. While in the background still
LAPACK or BLAS do all the job, you have a simple and clean API. And in case you
really need to call a LAPACK function yourself, you can still do so.


Examples
--------

Allocate a real 3x3 matrix::

    matrix_t *M = matrix_alloc(3,3);


Create a complex 4x4 matrix and initialize it as identity matrix::

    matrix_t *M = matrix_complex_eye(3,3);


Multiply two complex matrices and create a new matrix C=A*B::

    matrix_complex_t *C = matrix_complex_mult(A,B,NULL)


Calculate eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a generic complex matrix M::

    eig_complex_generic(M, w, NULL, vr);

A full example to invert a real matrix::

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <libhades.h>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        matrix_t *M = matrix_alloc(2,2);

        matrix_set(M, 0,0, 1);
        matrix_set(M, 0,1, 2);
        matrix_set(M, 1,0, 3);
        matrix_set(M, 1,1, 4);

        printf("Inverse of\n");
        matrix_fprintf(stdout, M, "%+4g", "  ", "\n");

        matrix_invert(M);
        
        printf("is:\n");
        matrix_fprintf(stdout, M, "%+4g", "  ", "\n");
         
        return 0;
    }


Installation
------------

At the moment there is no build system. Change to the directory libhades/ and run::

    make
This will compile the library. You need the development version of LAPACK and
BLAS installed on your computer.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available using Doxygen.


How to contribute
-----------------

Send bug reports, feature requests and merge requests! libhades is still in
development and there are probably a lot of bugs. I'm also happy for more unit
tests.
